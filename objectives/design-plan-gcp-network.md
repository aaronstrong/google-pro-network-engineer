# Designing, planning and prototyping a GCP network

## 1.1 Designing the overall network architecture. Considerations include:

* Failover and disaster recovery strategy
* Options for high availability
* DNS strategy (e.g., on-premises, Cloud DNS, GSLB)
* Meeting business requirements
* Choosing the appropriate load balancing options
* Optimizing for latency (e.g., MTU size, caches, CDN)
* Understanding how quotas are applied per project and per VPC
* Hybrid connectivity (e.g., Google private access for hybrid connectivity)
* Container networking
* IAM and security
* SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services
* Microsegmentation for security purposes (e.g., using metadata, tags)

## 1.2 Designing a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Considerations include:

Here is the [Best Practices and reference architecture for VPC design](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/best-practices-vpc-design).

Here is the detailed [VPC network overview](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc).

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network is a virtual version of a physical network, implemented inside of Google's production network. A VPC provides the following:
* Connectivity for VMs including GKE and App Engine flexible instances and other products built on top of Compute Engine VMs
* Offers natvie TCP/UPD Load Balancing and proxy systems for Internal HTTP(S) Load balancing.
* Connects to on-premises networks using Cloud VPN tunnels and Cloud interconnect attachments.

Project can contain multiple VPC networks.

[VPC Specifications](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc#specifications)

* VPC networks, including their associated routes and firewall rules are global resources. They are <i>not</i> associated with any particular region or zone.
* Subnets are regional resources. Each subnet defines a range of IP addresses.
* Traffic to and from instances can be controlled with network :fire: firewall rules. Rules are implemented on the VMs themselves, so traffic can only be controlled and logged as it leaves or arrives at a VM.
* VPC networks can be securely connected in hybrid environments by using Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect.
* VPC networks only support IPv4 unicast traffic. They do <b>not</b> support broadcast, multicast or IPv6 traffic <i>within</i> the network.

### Networks and subnets

Each VPC network consists of one or more useful IP range partitions called subnets. Each subnet is associated with a region. VPC networks do not have any IP address ranges associated with them. IP ranges are defined for the subnets.

A network must have at least one subnet before you can use it. Auto mode VPC networks create subnets in each region automatically. Custom mode VPC networks start with no subnets, giving you full control over subnet creation. You can create more than one subnet per region

### Subnet Creation Mode

Two types of VPC networks, determined by their subnet creation mode:
* Auto mode, one subnet from each region is automatically created within it. These are automatically created subnets use a set of predefined IP ranges that fit within the `10.128.0.0/9` CIDR block.
> :star: <b>Important</b> Production networks should be planned in advance and it's recommended to use custom mode VPC networks
* Custom mode, no subnets are automatically created. This type of network provides you with complete control over its subnets and IP ranges. You decide which subnets to create in regions that you choose by using IP ranges you specify.
* You can switch from auto mode to custom mode. One-way conversion; custom mode VPC networks cannot be changed to auto mode VPC networks.

Default network

Each new project starts with a default network, unless you disable it with an Org policy called `compute.skipDefaultNetworkCreation` constraint.

Considerations for auto mode VPC

---





* CIDR range for subnets
* IP addressing (e.g., static, ephemeral, private)
* Standalone or shared
* Multiple vs. single
* Multi-zone and multi-region
* Peering
* Firewall (e.g., service accountâ€“based, tag-based)
* Routes
* Differences between Google Cloud Networking and other cloud platforms

## 1.3 Designing a hybrid network. Considerations include:

* Using interconnect (e.g., dedicated vs. partner)
* Peering options (e.g., direct vs. carrier)
* IPsec VPN
* Cloud Router
* Failover and disaster recovery strategy (e.g., building high availability with BGP using cloud router)
* Shared vs. standalone VPC interconnect access
* Cross-organizational access
* Bandwidth
